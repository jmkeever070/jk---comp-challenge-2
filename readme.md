## Static-Comp-2
This is my Static Comp 2 challenge web design.

## What is it?
This page is the 4th project for Turing MOD 1 students.

## What is the objective?
This is a project designed for students to continue to improve their basic HTML and CSS skills. 

The goals are as follows:
To have a responsive, basic static site with index.html and styles.css. Site should work 
on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. Must use normalize in CSS instead of a reset file. 
Flex-box was allowed for use on this project.

## How it was made
Created with a combination of HMTL and CSS

## Coding Style
Standard HTML and CSS

## Challenges
With the holiday break and 3 different projects to work on this one was hard to complete fully. I feel I could have finished it completely but just ran short of time.
